# Bagging-on-Breast-Cancer-Dataset
This project demonstrates the use of ensemble learning through **Bagging** with a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classifier on the Breast Cancer dataset from scikit-learn. It compares the performance of a simple KNN model with a BaggingClassifier using KNN as the base estimator.
